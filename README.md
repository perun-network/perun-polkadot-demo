_perun-polkadot-demo_ allows you to interact with [perun](https://perun.network/) Payment-Channels over a CLI powered by [go-perun](https://github.com/perun-network/go-perun).  
It connects to our [Pallet] that runs on a [Polkadot Node] by using our [Polkadot Backend].

## Getting Started

Running _perun-polkadot-demo_ requires a recent [Go installation](https://golang.org), see `go.mod` for the required version. 
```sh
# Clone the repository into a directory of your choice
git clone https://github.com/perun-network/perun-polkadot-demo
cd perun-polkadot-demo
# Compile with
go build
# Check that the binary works
./perun-polkadot-demo --help
```

## Demo

Currently, the only available sub-command of _perun-polkadot-demo_ is `demo`, which starts the CLI node. The node's
configuration file can be chosen with the `--config` flag. Two sample
configurations `alice.yaml` and `bob.yaml` are provided. A default network
configuration for Alice and Bob is provided in file `network.yaml`.

## Example Walkthrough
In a first terminal, start a development [Polkadot Node]:
```sh
docker run --rm -it -p 127.0.0.1:9944:9944/tcp ghcr.io/perun-network/polkadot-test-node:docker-push
```

In a second terminal, start the node of Alice with
```sh
./perun-polkadot-demo demo --config alice.yaml
```
and in a third terminal, start the node of Bob with
```sh
./perun-polkadot-demo demo --config bob.yaml
```

Once both CLIs are running, e.g. in Alice's terminal, propose a payment channel
to Bob with 100 *Dot* deposit from both sides via the following command.
```
> open bob 100 100
```
In Bobs terminal, accept the appearing channel proposal.
```
üîÅ Incoming channel proposal from alice with funding [My: 100 Dot, Peer: 100 Dot].
Accept (y/n)? > y
```

You will see a message like `"Channel established with‚Ä¶"` in both terminals
after the on-chain funding completed.

Now you can execute off-chain payments, e.g. in Bob's terminal with
```
> send alice 10
```
The updated balance will immediately be printed in both terminals, but no
transaction will be visible in the ganache's terminal.

You may always check the current status with command `info`.

You can also run a performance benchmark with command
```
> benchmark alice 10 100
```
which will send 10 *Dot* in 100 micro-transactions from Bob to Alice. Transaction performance will be printed in a table.

Finally, you can settle the channel on either side with
```
> close alice
```

Now you can exit the CLI with command `exit` or `Ctrl+D`.
